
# 2. Improve the vacuum cleaning agentâ€™s efficiency by implementing a model-based agent. Provide your arguments.
# A model-based intelligent agent is an agent with internal state or memory. It uses this internal state to retain informaton regarding its environment/world. This information can then help the agent make its decisions afterwards. Here, the reflex agent from first question is improved as it is making use of self.room (i.e. the state of the room) to make informed movements. Particularly, the nearest_dirty_position() method is introduced which provides position/location of nearest dirty cell in the room with Euclidean distance measurement. This method is utilized by the updated move() method that moves the vacuum agent closer to this position instead of moving sequentially as was the previous case with reflex agent.

# We observe improvements as the steps taken by this model-based agent are almost always less than that of prior reflex agent.
